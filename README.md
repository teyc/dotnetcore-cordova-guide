# Readify .NET Core with Cordova Guide

Are you tired of following outdated blog posts, two year old stackoverflow answers to set up your development environment to work with mobile technologies?

Our goal here is to be the ultimate place for *crowd sourced* resource for setting up your development environment for a Cordova project with .NET core and Cordova on Windows, with VSTS.

Where possible, we provide PowerShell snippets that you can take away and assemble into your own project. Our philosophy here is not to provide you with pre-canned scripts, but with enough understanding that you can turn it into something that suits yourself.
